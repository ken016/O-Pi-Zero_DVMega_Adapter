# O-Pi-Zero_DVMega_Adapter

An adapter to allow the DVMega Digital Voice Modem to mount on an Orange Pi Zero.



### Notice

This is the second attempt at the PCB, and is so far untested. I can't make any guarantees it will work until they are manufactured and tested.

***PLEASE DON'T GET THIS BOARD MANUFACTURED UNTIL IT'S TESTED!!!***
