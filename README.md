# O-Pi-Zero_DVMega_Adapter

An adapter to allow the DVMega Digital Voice Modem to mount on an Orange Pi Zero.



### Notice

~~This is my first attempt at a PCB, and is so far untested. I can't make any guarantees it will work until they are manufactured and tested~~

This current board **DOES NOT WORK** due to an electrical issue. I will re-do the design in the coming days.

**PLEASE DON'T GET THIS BOARD MANUFACTURED IN ITS CURRENT STATE!!!***
